* Summary of set up
Install SourceTree as version control UI
Clone the repo using source tree
Open up your command prompt
Navigate to the directory where you have cloned the project
Type npm install and wait for all the magic to happen. If all is well, you should see a tree structure with all the dependancies installed. If you see any dependancy not installed try installing it manually.

Eg: if node-sass fails, first try the command npm rebuild node-sass. If it fails again, hit npm install node-sass -g

Once you have all setup, hit nodemon server
This will start up the app at http://localhost:3000 or localhost:3000
As of today, you should be able to see a blue screen with the message 'Angular App Loaded'. 
Open up your console. 
You should be able to see a Response Object which is requested by the client to the node server through web-sockets, executed at the node layer using the Request Object and the response is transmitted back to the Angular layer using web-sockets
